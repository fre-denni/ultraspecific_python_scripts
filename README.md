# Ultra specific Python scripts
I have a bunch of ultra-specific and weird python scripts laying around. I'm gonna start putting them here to share and have a repository of them.
Maybe someone will have a less specific use of them, maybe some of them are actually useful.

A list of them are:
- resize.py: I'm using this to resize all the memes in my meme folder to 491px height, as I find it good enough to be displayed on my desktop
- export.py: A script that I cobble together to use pandoc with obsidian links and convert them to citation using the Pandoc Reference List plugin for Obsidian. Yes it is a complete mess, why I do this to myself, I don't know. It gets as arguments the .md file to parse and the .docx file to output. Easily modifiable, ultra-specific to set up
